# What is Digital Garden?

'Digital garden' is a metaphor for a blog, which structures articles nonlinear way.
Each articles in a _garden_ are defined as a `seedling`, a `budding`, or a `evergreen.`

Usually,

- `seedlings` for very rough and early ideas
- `buddings` for work I've cleaned up and clarified
- `evergreens` for work that is reasonably complete (though I still tend these over
  time). [^garden-history]

Of course, details depends on its gardener.

# Why Digital Garden?

I'd like to call the general blogging as a _retail_, which exists to seek profit.
Digital garden

## Escape from obsession with the fresh idea.

Timestamps of articles in home feels like an expiration date.
It represents how much the post is fresh.
At the same time, it's a timer to lazy managers like me which shows how long has this blog been
abandoned.

On the other hand, the gardeners pave the roads for guests in Hyperlink driven.
They build their own doors, and connect the writings by writing as their way.
The paths can herd the visitors to a flower bed, an arboretum,
or a storage abundant with the fruits without encountering smells from fertilizer.

Retails must discard the products that has passed the date, of course,
no matter what it's not that differ from the next one which has born a few days later.  
Roots of seeds, trees and a sweetly scented flowers are always welcomed to grow,
as they are the family member of the garden.

## Escape from obsession with perfectionism.

To consider a writing is in a steps of plants growth free us from the [_perfectionism_](perfectionism.md).

Running a blog, it's hard to ignore the rules of search engine, 
which impose to categorize the articles, care about legibility to the robots, 
and stay tuned for the trends to drift the contents on their "sacred algorithm."
The dogmatic mediators grade web pages according to their law, and treat the rebels as a loser.
It's understandable that random customers judging the websites by the grades 
because they are just a tourist just got off from the cruises called Google, Bing, or etc.

Nobody blames on a tiny flower blooming inside the greenwoods.
Even though the smell of manure reeks aloud, 
it's hard to imagine visitors boo on the garden as failure.
The majority of the topic they care must be like "What kind of seeds have been planted?",
"How long they've been here", or "Can the seeds bear some eatable fruits?".

The gift to manage evergreen blogs not allowed to everybody.
Fortunately, planting an apple seed left from a dessert time is absolutely fine 
as long as we have a space for it.
In other words, to define ourselves as a `gardener` liberate us from the system of digital capitalism.
