# Terminology

- coroutine
    
    가벼운 쓰레드
    
- coroutine scope
    
    코루틴이 실행되는 범위
    
- coroutine builder
    
    Coroutine Scope의 확장자. (ex. launch, async)
    
    [coroutineContext](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-coroutine-scope/coroutine-context.html)를 상속받았다.
    
- coroutine scope builder
- suspending function
    
    중지 함수.
    
- Daemon thread
    
    우선순위가 낮은 쓰레드.
    
    - (in context of JVM) that runs in background to perform tasks such as garbage collection (gc) etc.,
    - they do not prevent the JVM from exiting (even if the daemon thread itself is running) when all the user threads (non-daemon threads) finish their execution [[ref]](https://beginnersbook.com/2015/01/daemon-thread-in-java-with-example/#:~:text=Daemon%20thread%20is%20a%20low,daemon%20threads)%20finish%20their%20execution.)

  

  

# Blocking, Non-blocking

  

## Blocking

- Thread.sleeping(Long)

```
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() {
    GlobalScope.launch { // launch a new coroutine in background and continue
        delay(1000L) // non-blocking delay for 1 second (default time unit is ms)
        println("World!") // print after delay
    }
    println("Hello,") // main thread continues while coroutine is delayed
    Thread.sleep(2000L) // block main thread for 2 seconds to keep JVM alive
}
```

  

## Non-Blocking

- delay(Long)

```
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() { 
    GlobalScope.launch { // launch a new coroutine in background and continue
        delay(1000L)
        println("World!")
    }
    println("Hello,") // main thread continues here immediately
    runBlocking {     // but this expression blocks the main thread
        delay(2000L)  // ... while we delay for 2 seconds to keep JVM alive
    } 
}
```

- runBlocking()

```
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking<Unit> { // start main coroutine
    GlobalScope.launch { // launch a new coroutine in background and continue
        delay(1000L)
        println("World!")
    }
    println("Hello,") // main coroutine continues here immediately
    delay(2000L)      // delaying for 2 seconds to keep JVM alive
}
```
