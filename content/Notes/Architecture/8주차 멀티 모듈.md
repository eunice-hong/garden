### HOMEWORK 🏡

1. repository data source 옮기기
   1. app / data / local / remote 나누기
2. app에 local / remote interface 만들고, local/ remote에서 impl 구현 → internal로 사용할 수 없게 만들기
   1. app → data ← local/remote

- `implementation` → 해당 모듈 안에서만 사용하겠다
- `api` → 나를 import하는 곳에서도 사용할 수 있게 하겠다

### Error Handling like a pro 😎

> [!info] Android: Error handling in Clean Architecture

Sometimes it's confusing how to propagate errors crossing boundaries between layers. Our Clean Architecture brief: Domain : entities and business logic Data : data sources, repositories, providers, 3rd-party services, platform-specific stuff...

### What is `sealed`?

> [!info] Sealed classes in Kotlin: enums with super-powers  
> Sealed classes in Kotlin are another new concept we didn't have in Java, and open another new world of possibilities. A sealed class allows you to represent constrained hierarchies in which an object can only be of one of the given types. That is, we have a class with a specific number of subclasses.

2. create resource provider
