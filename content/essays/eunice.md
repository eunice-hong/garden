Why I Call Myself “Eunice”

Growing up, I often found it challenging to introduce myself to non-Koreans. My Korean name, while meaningful and beautiful to me, often posed a challenge for others to pronounce. Over time, this small yet recurring issue started to feel like an unnecessary barrier in my interactions.

In an effort to make things easier—for both myself and the people I met—I began searching for an alternative name that was simple, easy to pronounce, and still resonated with me. I wanted something that felt natural, not forced, and reflected a part of who I am.

That’s when I came across the name “Eunice.” It caught my eye immediately. The name was easy to pronounce and spell, and it had a certain elegance that appealed to me. It felt like a perfect fit, and adopting it as my English name has made introductions and conversations much smoother ever since.
